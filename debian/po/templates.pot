"xcp-networkd supports two network backends: standard Linux bridging and Open "
"vSwitch. While both modes support a similar feature set, Open vSwitch "
"provides additional features such as QoS, monitoring, and control using the "
"OpenFlow protocol. These additional features are not controlled directly "
"through the XenAPI, but can instead be enabled and controlled through the "
"ovs-* suite of commands."
